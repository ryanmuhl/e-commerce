# E_Commerce
Challenge 13 Bootcamp

## Purpose
Create a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technolgies so that my company can compete with other e-commerce companies.

## Website Functionality/Class Criteria Met
* Given a functional Express.js API,  when a user enters a database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environmental variable file (.env), the user is able to connect to a database using Sequelize.
* When a user enters schema and seed commands via node schema.sql or node seeds.js, then a development database is created and is seeded with test data.
* When the user enters a command to invoke the application (node server.js), then the server is started and the sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database.
* When the user opens api get routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags, data for each of those routes is displayed in JSON format.
* When a user tests Api POST, PUT, DELETE routes in insomnia,  the user is successfully able to create, update, and delete data in the database.



## Difficulties/Problems Encountered
* Managing foreigh Keys and how to join tables is difficult concept to grasp.  This is a concept that will hopefully get easier with more practice and coding scenarios.

## Built With
* MYSQL
* NODE.JS
* Insomnia
* dotenv
* express
* nodemon
* sequelize
